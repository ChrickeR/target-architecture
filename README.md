## Target Architecture Anti-patterns
* [Traditional Digital Strategy](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/digital-strategy-dead)
* [Architecture as a Recipe](http://doveltech.com/innovation/the-beginning-of-the-end-for-enterprise-architecture-frameworks/)

## How To Use The Target Architecture
1. The target architecture is the desired state
2. Evaluate every system, process, organizational structure etc.
 * For-Each, decide on and develop, one of two things
   * Decommission Strategy
    * Transformation Strategy
4. "This is your wake-up call, pal. Go to work." - [Gordon Gekko](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/quotes)
