# Target Architecture
An Opinionated Target Architecture Intended For Mid-sized Insurance Companies And Companies Alike

## Definition Of Target Architecture
> The description of a future state of the architecture being developed for an organization. There may be several future states developed as a roadmap to show the evolution of the architecture to a target state.

Source: [TOGAF® Version 9.1](http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap03.html#tag_03_71)

## Values
* The target architecture shall
  * Set the direction
  * Set the boundaries
  * Give guidance
  * Not be overly prescriptive
  * Be constantly evolving
* We standardize only when
  * Deemed necessary for the sake of interoperability
  * There is clearly a "better way of doing it"

## Target Architecture Anti-patterns

* [Architecture as a Recipe](http://doveltech.com/innovation/the-beginning-of-the-end-for-enterprise-architecture-frameworks/)

## How To Use The Target Architecture
1. The target architecture is the desired state
2. Evaluate every system, process, organizational structure etc.
 * For-Each, decide on and develop, one of two things
   * Decommission Strategy
    * Transformation Strategy
4. "This is your wake-up call, pal. Go to work." - [Gordon Gekko](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/quotes)
