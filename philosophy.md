## Autonomy, Mastery And Purpose
> Based on studies done at MIT and other universities, higher pay and bonuses resulted in better performance ONLY if the task consisted of basic, mechanical skills. It worked for problems with a defined set of steps and a single answer. If the task involved cognitive skills, decision-making, creativity, or higher-order thinking, higher pay resulted in lower performance. As a supervisor, you should pay employees enough that they are not focused on meeting basic needs and feel that they are being paid fairly. If you don’t pay people enough, they won’t be motivated. Pink suggests that you should pay enough “to take the issue of money off the table.”

To motivate employees who work beyond basic tasks, give them these three factors to increase performance and satisfaction:
* _Autonomy_ — Our desire to be self directed. It increases engagement over compliance.
* _Mastery_ — The urge to get better skills.
* _Purpose_ — The desire to do something that has meaning and is important. Businesses that only focus on profits without valuing purpose will end up with poor customer service and unhappy employees.

## Radical Agility
> You may have heard about our cutting-edge approach to the way we work at Zalando Tech – it’s called Radical Agility.

> With Zalando being a platform, we’re growing fast in terms of ambition and scope, so we’re managing our complexity through our people, products, and teams. By utilising Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose, the three pillars of Radical Agility, we want to strengthen our position as the most fashionable tech company in Europe.

> But what exactly is Radical Agility? This methodology sees developers working in autonomous teams, with the company trusting that they'll use the technologies that best fit the job. This all happens amongst team members without the restraints of a traditional, hierarchical management structure. Our management’s role in Radical Agility is instead used to guide the decision-making of teams, while establishing and aligning with employees on the company’s shared purpose and goals.
